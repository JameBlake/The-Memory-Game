## Instructions

### What is the Memory Game?

The Memory Game consists of 16 cards and the aim is to pair the cards up with the same image.

### It sounds great! How does one play?

_It's simple!_

1. Click on any card to begin. **Warning!** Opening the first pair will start the timer! (Are you mentally prepared for this challenge?).
Once the card has been clicked, the card will reveal it's image.

2. Click on another card. This second image will be revealed. _Is it the same as the first image?_

If the answer is **"Yes"**, you have managed to match your first pair. **Congratulations!!** The matched cards will change color and will stay open.

If the answer is **"No!"**, please remember what images you saw before they are hidden behind their respective cards.

Your job, if you choose to accept it is....

-to match all 8 pairs of cards as fast as you can and in as few as moves as you can.

## Are you up to the challenge?

The game ends once all the pairs have been matched. The time that it took to complete the game will appear at the end and also the number of moves that it took.

A **maximum** of **3 stars** will be awarded if the game is completed in **under 10 moves**.

**2 stars** will be awarded if **no more than 15 moves** are taken.

**1 star** will be awarded for games that took **over 15 moves** to complete.

A reset button is also available which will reset;

-the timer,
-the move counter,
-the number of stars;
-and will also cause the cards to shuffle.

I hope you had fun playing this game! Why not play it again? Hit that play button and shuffle those cards!
